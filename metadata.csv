WA_400m_Grav_Merge_v1_2016.ers,gravity_merged,um/s^2,WA State grid merge of Gravity data,Australian National Gravity Database (ANGD) and includes GA/GSWA gravity surveys which were acquired during 2013. Data over the marine region is sourced from the Geoscience Australia June 2009 offshore-onshore gravity grid which uses offshore data derived exclusively from satellite altimetry,"This grid combines onshore Spherical Cap Bouguer gravity anomalies with offshore Free-air anomalies for Western Australia. Data over the continental region has been gridded from the Australian National Gravity Database (ANGD) and includes GA/GSWA gravity surveys which were acquired during 2013. Data over the marine region is sourced from the Geoscience Australia June 2009 offshore-onshore gravity grid which uses offshore data derived exclusively from satellite altimetry. The horizontal datum and projection are GDA94 GEODETIC. The grid cell size is 0.00416666 degrees (approx 400 metres). The data are in units of micrometres per second squared (μms-2) which is equivalent to 0.1 milligals. The recommended reference for this grid is ""Geological Survey of Western Australia 2013 gravity merged 400m grid of Western Australia""."
WA_20m_Mag_Merge_v1_2014.ers,total_magnetic_intensity,nT,20 m magnetic merged grid of Western Australia,Federal and State government data sets acquired with a line spacing of 500 metres or less and over 1100 open file Company data sets at various line spacings,The grid combines merged magnetic anomaly data from onshore and offshore WA. It is generated from Federal and State government data sets acquired with a line spacing of 500 metres or less and over 1100 open file Company data sets at various line spacings. It also includes Menzies to Norseman multi-client data purchased by GSWA from CGG Australia (formerly Fugro Airborne Surveys). The Geoscience Australia magnetic grid of Australia V5 2010 (Milligan et al. 2010) has been used as a base reference grid and is also used to complete the background areas where closer spaced data are not available. The grid was created using the GridMerge program available commercially in the Intrepid software.
